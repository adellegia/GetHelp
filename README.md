# GetHelp
<br>
Get Help is envisioned to be a platform that connects students of the Hertie School with each other in
times of urgent need. The platform aims to provide "helping" services such as tutoring, grocery shopping,
or basically anything that requires a helping hand.


The program will be built from a matching algorithm that pairs users based on the type of help that a student
wants to receive and the type of help that a student can provide in exchange. Students will input the details
of their "get help" situation on the platform and the algorithm will provide their match â€“ another student who
also needs help and is willing to provide help in return.
