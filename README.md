# GetHelp


## Summary
<b>GetHelp</b> is envisioned to be a platform that connects students of the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) with each other in
times of urgent need. The platform aims to provide <i>"helping"</i> services such as tutoring, grocery shopping,
or basically anything that requires a helping hand.

The program will be built from a matching algorithm that pairs users based on the type of help that a student
wants to receive and the type of help that a student can provide in exchange. Students will input the details
of their <i>"get help"</i> situation on the platform and the algorithm will provide their match – another student who
also needs help and is willing to provide help in return.
